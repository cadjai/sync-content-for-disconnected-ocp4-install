# sync-content-for-disconnected-ocp4-install
This repo is to pull and sync OCP 4 images to use for a disconnected install.
This first version focuses on just pulling images but the next will also include operatorhub content.

For version 4.2.10 you need at least 14G of storage where you are saving the images to and if using and iso format you would need twice as much. To be on the safe side it is recommneded to have at least 20 GB if not creating the iso or 40GB if creeating an iso file of the images and manifest files.
